# ENG-DEU-Translator
### Why Translations is important?
Translation is necessary for the spread of information, knowledge, and ideas. It is absolutely necessary for effective and empathetic communication between different cultures.
Translation, therefore, is critical for social harmony and peace.

### What are Transformers?
The Transformer is a deep learning model. Transformers have rapidly become the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing older recurrent neural network models such as the long short-term memory (LSTM). Transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization.

### Model used for Translator?
There are many pre-trained models for language translation available in Hugging Face models. I used the "translation_en_to_de" pre-trained model for the translation of English to German language.

### Work Flow
* Pre-Trained deep learning transformer model is used to translate the English text to German.
* Using Flask, created a webpage that takes both text and audio files and translates it to German language.
* Deployed the Flask app from Netlify deployment website.
